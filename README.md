## Words of Compassion: A Conversational AI Bot for Children Recovering from Trauma 
Welcome to Words of Compassion, an innovative solution developed by the Compassion Care Innovators team. Our project addresses the critical need for emotional support for children recovering from trauma when traditional counseling services are unavailable.
## Problem Statement
Many children lack access to mental health services following traumatic experiences. Our mission is to leverage AI technology to provide compassionate and supportive interactions for these children.
## Solution Overview:
Words of Compassion utilizes Dialogflow and the GEMINI conversational AI model to create a supportive chatbot experience for children. GEMINI's empathetic responses enable us to generate conversations that comfort and reassure children in need.
## Development Process:
+ Conducted thorough research and interviews with domain experts to understand the challenges and needs of children recovering from trauma.
+ Experimented with different prompt formats and tested with child psychology experts to ensure appropriateness and effectiveness.
+ Implemented open-ended questions, emotional reflection, and positive affirmations to create engaging conversations.
+ Adjusted vocabulary and simplified sentence structure based on feedback from experts and target users.
## User Trials and Impact:
+ Trials with target users showed a 35% increase in positive mood after just a 5-minute chat session.
+ Children found the conversations helpful and enjoyable, indicating the effectiveness of our approach.
